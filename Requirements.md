# Requirements Identification and Scope

## High-Level Requirements:
•	Data Acquisition: Obtain daily share price information from a data source (e.g., Yahoo Finance) for a specified time range.

•	Data Storage: Persistently store share price data for offline functionality.

•	Data Visualization: Display graphs of daily share price over time ranges for one or two companies.

•	User Interface: Provide a user-friendly interface for inputting parameters and viewing results.

•	Scalability: Design the application to handle a large number of users and data volume.

•	Robustness: Ensure the application is reliable and can handle errors gracefully.

## Manageable Tasks:
•	Data Acquisition Module: Implement the logic to fetch share price data from the data source.

•	Data Storage Module: Choose and implement a suitable data storage mechanism (e.g., SQLite, JSON).

•	Data Visualization Module: Create a charting component to display share price graphs.

•	User Interface Module: Design and implement the user interface for input and output.

•	Architecture Design: Define the overall architectural structure of the application (e.g., Simple Architecture, Clean Architecture).

•	Scalability Enhancements: Implement techniques to improve the application's performance under high load.

•	Robustness Enhancements: Add error handling mechanisms and ensure data integrity.

## Initial Release Scope:

•	Basic Data Acquisition: Fetch daily share price data for a single company within a one-year time range.

•	Simple Data Storage: Store share price data in a text format (e.g., JSON).

•	Basic Data Visualization: Display a line chart of daily share price for a single company.

•	User Interface: Implement a simple user interface for inputting the company symbol and time range.

•	Simple Architecture: Use a basic architectural design with minimal separation of concerns.
